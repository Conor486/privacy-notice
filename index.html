    <h1>Scalis Privacy Notice</h1>
    
    <p class="meta">
        <strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 July 2025<br>
        <strong>Version:</strong> 1.1
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Notice describes how Scalis LLC ("Scalis") handles your personal data: how we receive, why and how we process, and how we safeguard personal data. We tell you what rights you have, how to exercise those rights and how to contact us if you have questions or concerns.</p>

    <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Scalis LLC ("us", "we", or "our"), operates the <a href="https://scalis.ai">https://scalis.ai</a> website and provides commercial software, products, services and applications, and other professional services (the "Platform" or "Service"). If you have any questions or feedback about this Policy, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a> with "Privacy" in the subject line or write to us at:</p>
    
    <div class="contact-box">
        Scalis LLC<br>
        1000 Brickell Ave., Suite 71<br>
        Miami, FL 33131
    </div>

    <p>Scalis respects your privacy. We handle your personal data responsibly and are committed to safeguarding your personal data. We act in your best interests and are transparent about personal data processing.</p>

    <p>This Notice applies only to personal information, not to de-identified or aggregate information or other information that cannot identify you.</p>

    <p>Access to and use of Scalis Platform or Services are subject to the Scalis Terms of Service and User Code of Conduct. Certain elements of the Platform or Service may operate under separate or additional terms of practice different from or in addition to those described in this Notice; in those cases, you will be provided separate notice and information relevant to your use of those parts of the Platform or Service.</p>

    <p>Please read this Notice carefully. Also, please read our Cookie Notice, which tells you how we use cookies and other similar tracking technologies. We regularly review and update this Notice, so we recommend visiting this page occasionally. If we communicate with you, we may notify you of significant changes to privacy practices or processing activities on your personal data. We will notify you before any significant changes to personal data processing begin, such as if we plan to use automated processing or artificial intelligence for decision making.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>our (potential) customers, contractors, clients, suppliers and other commercial relations.</li>

        <li>all other persons in contact with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Protection Authority</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you also have the right to (i) restrict Scalis's use of Information that constitutes your Personal Data and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which is Scalis's lead supervisory authority in the European Union. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may direct questions or complaints to <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.com">privacy@scalis.com</a> or to our lead supervisory authority:</p>

    <div class="contact-box">
        <strong>Irish Data Protection Commissioner</strong><br>
        Office of the Data Protection Commissioner<br>
        Canal House, Station Road<br>
        Portarlington, Co. Laois, R32 AP23, Ireland<br>
        Phone: +353 57 868 4757<br>
        Fax: +353 57 868 4757<br>
        Email: <a href="https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact">https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact</a>
    </div>

    <p>If you are a resident of the United Kingdom and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the applicable laws relating to personal data in the United Kingdom, you may direct questions or complaints to the UK supervisory authority, the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Terms and Principles</h2>
    <p>Scalis observes applicable privacy and data protection law in the markets we serve, when processing personal data. This includes European Union's and United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), GDPR variations in the European Economic Area, US States' privacy law and other data protection law as required.</p>

    <p>Generally, personal data are data that can be directly or indirectly traced back to, and identify, a natural person, referred to as a "data subject."</p>

    <p>Personal data processing can refer to anything we might do with personal data, such as collecting, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, updating, or modifying, retrieving, consulting, using, providing by transmission, distributing, making available, aligning, combining, shielding, deleting, or destroying.</p>

    <p>Scalis observes core principles when processing personal data. The data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>are processed lawfully, properly, and transparently;</li>
        <li>are processed only for the purpose for which they were collected (purpose limitation);</li>
        <li>are processed as little as possible (data minimization);</li>
        <li>are processed correctly (accuracy of data);</li>
        <li>will not be kept longer than necessary (storage and retention limitation);</li>
        <li>are transferred internationally under applicable international regulations;</li>
        <li>are processed with safeguards in technical and organizational controls to address security, integrity, and confidentiality; and</li>
        <li>are processed in systems, programs and services with privacy and security by design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collection And Processing</h2>
    <p>Scalis may be a personal Data Controller or a personal Data Processor, or both, depending upon the nature of the processing and the commercial relationship associated with that processing. A data controller, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of the relevant personal data. A data processor processes the relevant personal data based on the instructions of the data controller. In applicable data protection law, Scalis may be a Data Disclosure or a Data Receiver. A discloser sends personal data to a receiver for processing or onward transfer for processing. A processor receives personal data for processing or onward transfer for processing. As the provider of an AI-driven platform, we primarily act as a Data Controller for the personal data processed by our Matching Engine to provide our core services.</p>

    <p>The data collection and processing activities described in this section, including the use of artificial intelligence and automated processing, are integral to the functionality of our Platform. We use our proprietary AI Matching Engine to analyze user information and activity data to generate candidate recommendations and job matches. To provide these services, and as further detailed in our "Data Sharing and Third Parties" section, we leverage specialist third-party vendors to help us collect, store, and analyze this data. Your use of our services constitutes your agreement to these comprehensive data practices. If you do not consent to this, you should not access or use the Platform.</p>

    <h3>What personal data might we process?</h3>
    <p>Scalis may process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>personal data that you provide to us, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>identity information and personal details;</li>
                <li>contact details;</li>
                <li>details as described in a curriculum vitae or employment history;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>personal data obtained through means of communication and interaction, such as our browsing our website, receiving newsletters, and sending and receiving emails:
            <ul>
                <li>identity information and personal details</li>
                <li>contact details;</li>
                <li>information about the device with which you visited our website, such as an IP address;</li>
                <li>your browsing activity on our website, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>which data/web pages you have viewed;</li>
                        <li>how you navigated the website;</li>
                        <li>whether you opened a newsletter or email and which parts did you click;</li>
                        <li>dates and times of your visit to the website;</li>
                        <li>operating system you are using;</li>
                        <li>Internet address of the website to which a link is made;</li>
                        <li>geo-location;</li>
                        <li>data sent to us; or</li>
                        <li>data downloaded from the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Personal data obtained from other sources:
            <ul>
                <li>data available from public sources such as, but not limited to, LinkedIn;</li>
                <li>data obtained from the official public sources;</li>
                <li>data available on public business websites; or</li>
                <li>data obtained from your employer or client.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This data is the essential fuel for our AI model. We use it to train, operate, and improve the automated matching services we provide.</p>

    <p><strong>See Appendix A -- Data Processing Annex</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How Scalis Uses Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Our AI assists recruiters and candidates by analyzing text and structured data. AI supports—but does not replace—human decision-making. We do not use facial recognition, emotion detection, or biometric categorization.</p>

    <h3>AI Processing Activities</h3>
    <p>The table below describes how we use AI in our Platform:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Module</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Technology</th>
                <th>Human Oversight</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Résumé analysis & matching</td>
                <td>Identify skills/experience that match job requirements</td>
                <td>Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic vector embeddings</td>
                <td>Recruiters review shortlists before outreach</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Candidate ranking / scoring</td>
                <td>Suggest a numerical "fit score" (0–100)</td>
                <td>Machine-learning classifiers (e.g., decision trees / gradient boosting)</td>
                <td>Human review and override required</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Interview summarization</td>
                <td>Generate text summaries of interviews</td>
                <td>Transformer-based language models</td>
                <td>Human validation before record is stored</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Meaningful Information About the Logic Involved</h3>
    <p>Our models evaluate patterns aligned to the role (skills, tenure, recency, similarity to requirements) to produce a recommendation for recruiter review. Final hiring decisions are made by humans.</p>

    <h3>Fairness and Bias Mitigation</h3>
    <p>We conduct periodic fairness and bias testing and monitor performance to reduce disparate impact across demographic groups. A summary of our independent Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIIA) and Bias Audit will be published in our Trust Center when available. To request access under NDA, email <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why do we process personal data?</h2>
    <p>Scalis may process your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide our core AI-driven recruitment and matching services. This is our primary purpose. It involves using automated systems and AI to analyze personal data (like skills, experience, and job requirements) to create profiles and predict the suitability of candidates for specific roles and vice-versa.</li>
        <li>To manage, secure, and improve our Platform, including the performance of our AI models.</li>
        <li>For commercial contract purposes, such as fulfilling our service obligations to an employer using our Platform.</li>
        <li>To measure the use of our website and services.</li>
        <li>To contact you about newsletters or other marketing, but only if you have opted in.</li>
        <li>To verify your identity when necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>By what legal means do we process personal data?</h2>
    <p><strong>Scalis may process your data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>if you have given us permission to process personal data for one or more specific purposes. We are transparent and inform you so you can grant or remove consent with genuine choice and control;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for the performance of an agreement to which you are a party, or to take measures at your request prior to the conclusion of an agreement;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for our legitimate interest or of a third party unless your rights and interests outweigh either our or the third-party's legitimate interest;</li>
        <li>if processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another natural person;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>You have rights.</strong></p>
    <p>You can ask us by any means, but sometimes under certain restrictions or conditions, to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>provide access to personal data;</li>
        <li>restrict or object to processing;</li>
        <li>rectify errors or erase personal data; or</li>
        <li>receive a portable copy of personal data;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can complain to a supervisory authority that is the data protection regulator.</p>

    <p>You may exercise these rights by submitting your request in writing or by phone to us, adjusting preferences in our consent manager, <strong>myConsentChoice</strong>, or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a>. We are required to verify your identity before your request can be met.</p>

    <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise below, we will respond to your request without undue delay, and within one month. In principle, your requests will be processed electronically (and will therefore be replied to by email), unless this is not possible, or you request otherwise.</p>

    <p>In principle, we will not charge you for request processing, unless your requests are excessive, manifestly unfounded or if you request additional copies when exercising your right of access, and charges are subject to applicable data protection law.</p>

    <h3>Viewing and/or modifying data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us at any time, by any means, to indicate which categories of your personal data we hold or are processed, for which purposes, from which data source, and what retention period(s) is(are) applied. In addition, you can ask us at any time to complete, correct or delete your data. We will correct inaccurate personal data we have about you. If we have changed your personal data, we will notify you accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Limit the processing of your data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to temporarily restrict, object to or withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data. We will tell you if we cannot honor your request and explain why.</p>

    <h3>Ask to transfer personal data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to provide to you or a third party your personal data in a structured, common, and machine-readable form.</p>

    <h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to delete your personal data. We will tell you if we cannot honour your request and explain why.</p>

    <p>Exercising your rights does not affect processing that has already taken place, unless incorrect data has been used in previous processing and it can be reprocessed with correct data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Platform and services are not intended for or directed at individuals under the age of <strong>18</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a person under 18, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a></p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Security is a core part of our mission, and we take the protection of your information seriously. We apply industry-standard technical, organizational, and administrative measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, misuse, loss, or disclosure. These safeguards are designed to reflect the sensitivity of the information we collect, process, and store, as well as the current state of technology.</p>

    <p>Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. For this reason, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information. If you use links that take you to third-party websites, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those sites.</p>

    <h2>Cookie Notice: Cookies And Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Scalis uses cookies and tracking technologies on our websites.</p>

    <p>In this Cookie Notice, we inform you about our cookies practices, a listing of cookies that are always enabled and others that are enabled after consent, their purpose and details such as classification, provider/domain, and retention period before expiry.</p>

    <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer to provide control for current functions while browsing our websites, for recognition of preferences on subsequent visits to our websites, and for third-party features.</p>

    <p>We use some cookies as strictly necessary components of our websites. We use other cookies in functional, analytical, and marketing categories only when you <a href="https://www.leco.com/privacy/">provide consent directly with <strong>myConsentChoice</strong></a> or when your browser provides preference information to myConsentChoice in the browser session.</p>

    <p>You will be prompted with <a href="https://www.leco.com/privacy/">the <strong>myConsentChoice</strong></a> when visiting our websites. You can accept or reject all optional cookies or manage preferences within the consent manager. You can <a href="https://www.leco.com/privacy/">change your preferences</a> to grant or withdraw consent at any time.</p>

    <h3>Consent Expiry</h3>
    <p>We remember your consent preferences for 30 days. You can change your consent preferences at any time by clicking on the <strong>Manage Consent</strong> link from our website's footer. You can then adjust the available preference sliders to 'On' or 'Off', and save by clicking 'Save Choices'. You may need to refresh your page for your settings to take effect. The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user-identifiers (e.g., User-IDs) or advertising-identifiers are automatically deleted after the third-party expiry period. Monthly deletions for expired cookies and tracking technologies are processed automatically.</p>

    <h3>Google Processing</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited ("Google") is then enabled on our websites. The use includes the "Universal Analytics" operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions, and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and then analyse activities across devices.</p>

    <p>Google may transfer to and process consent-granted personal data in the United States. However, as IP anonymisation (IP masking) is activated on our websites, your IP address will be shortened by Google in advance within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states per the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of our use of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. Further information on terms of use and data protection can be found at <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html</a> or <a href="https://policies.google.com/?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/?hl=en</a>.</p>

    <h3>Purposes of Google Processing</h3>
    <p>Google will use personal data provided to evaluate your use of our websites, to compile reports on website activity and other services related to website use.</p>

    <h3>Legal Basis of Google Processing</h3>
    <p>Consent is the legal basis for Google Analytics.</p>

    <h3>Recipients or Categories of Recipients</h3>
    <p>Google is the recipient of the collected data and is an independent controller.</p>

    <p>You can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881">Browser Add-on</a>. Opt-out cookies will prevent future collection of your data when you visit our website. To prevent Universal Analytics from collecting data across different devices, you must opt-out on all systems used. If you click here, the opt-out cookie will be set: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881">Disable Google Analytics.</a></p>

    <p><strong>See Appendix B -- Cookie and Browser Storage.</strong></p>

    <h2>Third Parties and International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Scalis may engage third parties who process personal data as part of our Platform or Services. These third-party sub-processors act on our instruction under contract and under the same purposes and lawful bases set out in this privacy statement. These may be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(government) organizations;</li>
        <li>service providers; or</li>
        <li>contractors/suppliers, including but not limited to suppliers of IT services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Scalis remains accountable for personal data processing of our sub-processors as described in the Privacy Notice and under applicable data protection law.</p>
