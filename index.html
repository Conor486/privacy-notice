    <h1>Scalis Privacy Notice</h1>
    
    <p class="meta">
        <strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 July 2025<br>
        <strong>Version:</strong> 1.1
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Notice describes how Scalis LLC ("Scalis") handles your personal data: how we receive, why and how we process, and how we safeguard personal data. We tell you what rights you have, how to exercise those rights and how to contact us if you have questions or concerns.</p>

    <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Scalis LLC ("us", "we", or "our"), operates the <a href="https://scalis.ai">https://scalis.ai</a> website and provides commercial software, products, services and applications, and other professional services (the "Platform" or "Service").

    <div class="contact-box">
        Scalis LLC<br>
        1000 Brickell Ave., Suite 71<br>
        Miami, FL 33131
    </div>

    <p>Scalis respects your privacy. We handle your personal data responsibly and are committed to safeguarding your personal data. We act in your best interests and are transparent about personal data processing.</p>

    <p>This Notice applies only to personal information, not to de-identified or aggregate information or other information that cannot identify you.</p>

    <p>Access to and use of Scalis Platform or Services are subject to the Scalis Terms of Service and User Code of Conduct.

    <h2>Data Protection Authority</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you have the right to (i) restrict Scalis's use of Information that constitutes your Personal Data and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>

    <p><strong>We would appreciate the chance to resolve your concerns directly.</strong> If you wish to raise a complaint, please contact our Data Protection Officer who will investigate the matter: <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a></p>

    <p>However, you always retain the right to lodge a complaint directly with the appropriate supervisory authority.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may direct questions or complaints to <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a> or to your local supervisory authority in your EU member state. A complete list of EU/EEA supervisory authorities is available at the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en">European Data Protection Board</a>. You may also contact our Article 27 EU Representative listed below, who can receive complaints on our behalf.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident of the United Kingdom and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the UK GDPR, you may direct questions or complaints to the UK supervisory authority, the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, or to our Article 27 UK Representative listed below.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident of Switzerland and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), you may direct questions or complaints to the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) at <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch</a>.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Terms and Principles</h2>
    <p>Scalis observes applicable privacy and data protection law in the markets we serve, when processing personal data. This includes European Union's and United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), GDPR variations in the European Economic Area, Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), US States' privacy law and other data protection law as required.</p>

    <p>Generally, personal data are data that can be directly or indirectly traced back to, and identify, a natural person, referred to as a "data subject."</p>

    <p>Personal data processing can refer to anything we might do with personal data, such as collecting, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, updating, or modifying, retrieving, consulting, using, providing by transmission, distributing, making available, aligning, combining, shielding, deleting, or destroying.</p>

    <p>Scalis observes core principles when processing personal data. The data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>are processed lawfully, properly, and transparently;</li>
        <li>are processed only for the purpose for which they were collected (purpose limitation);</li>
        <li>are processed as little as possible (data minimization);</li>
        <li>are processed correctly (accuracy of data);</li>
        <li>will not be kept longer than necessary (storage and retention limitation);</li>
        <li>are transferred internationally under applicable international regulations;</li>
        <li>are processed with safeguards in technical and organizational controls to address security, integrity, and confidentiality; and</li>
        <li>are processed in systems, programs and services with privacy and security by design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collection And Processing</h2>
    <p>Scalis may be a personal Data Controller or a personal Data Processor, or both, depending upon the nature of the processing and the commercial relationship associated with that processing. A data controller, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of the relevant personal data. A data processor processes the relevant personal data based on the instructions of the data controller. In applicable data protection law, Scalis may be a Data Disclosure or a Data Receiver. A discloser sends personal data to a receiver for processing or onward transfer for processing. A processor receives personal data for processing or onward transfer for processing. As the provider of an AI-driven platform, we primarily act as a Data Controller for the personal data processed by our Matching Engine to provide our core services.</p>

    <p>The data collection and processing activities described in this section, including the use of artificial intelligence and automated processing, are integral to the functionality of our Platform. We use our proprietary AI Matching Engine to analyze user information and activity data to generate candidate recommendations and job matches. To provide these services, and as further detailed in our "Data Sharing and Third Parties" section, we leverage specialist third-party vendors to help us collect, store, and analyze this data. Your use of our services constitutes your agreement to these comprehensive data practices. If you do not consent to this, you should not access or use the Platform.</p>

    <h3>What personal data might we process?</h3>
    <p>Scalis may process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>personal data that you provide to us, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>identity information and personal details;</li>
                <li>contact details;</li>
                <li>details as described in a curriculum vitae or employment history;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>personal data obtained through means of communication and interaction, such as our browsing our website, receiving newsletters, and sending and receiving emails:
            <ul>
                <li>identity information and personal details</li>
                <li>contact details;</li>
                <li>information about the device with which you visited our website, such as an IP address;</li>
                <li>your browsing activity on our website, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>which data/web pages you have viewed;</li>
                        <li>how you navigated the website;</li>
                        <li>whether you opened a newsletter or email and which parts did you click;</li>
                        <li>dates and times of your visit to the website;</li>
                        <li>operating system you are using;</li>
                        <li>Internet address of the website to which a link is made;</li>
                        <li>geo-location;</li>
                        <li>data sent to us; or</li>
                        <li>data downloaded from the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Personal data obtained from other sources:
            <ul>
                <li>data available from public sources such as, but not limited to, LinkedIn;</li>
                <li>data obtained from the official public sources;</li>
                <li>data available on public business websites; or</li>
                <li>data obtained from your employer or client.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This data is the essential fuel for our AI model. We use it to train, operate, and improve the automated matching services we provide.</p>

    <p><strong>See Appendix A -- Data Processing Annex</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How Scalis Uses Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Scalis is an end-to-end recruiting system that unifies sourcing, CRM, ATS, scheduling, interviewing, and analytics into a single platform. Across each of these stages, AI is built in to assist, optimize, and refine the recruiting process — never to replace it.</p>

    <h3>AI Processing Activities</h3>
    <p>The table below describes how we use AI in our Platform:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Module</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Technology</th>
                <th>Human Oversight</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Résumé analysis &amp; matching</td>
                <td>Identify skills/experience that match job requirements</td>
                <td>Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic vector embeddings</td>
                <td>Recruiters review shortlists before outreach</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Candidate ranking / scoring</td>
                <td>Suggest a numerical "fit score" (0–100)</td>
                <td>Machine-learning classifiers (e.g., decision trees / gradient boosting)</td>
                <td>Human review and override required</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Interview summarization</td>
                <td>Generate text summaries of interviews</td>
                <td>Transformer-based language models</td>
                <td>Human validation before record is stored</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Meaningful Information About the Logic Involved</h3>
    <p>Recruiting teams have full control over when and how AI is used. For example, AI can help identify and rank candidates, automate resume parsing, or suggest next steps based on historical hiring data, but every action remains human-guided and reviewable. The platform is designed so that users can toggle between manual and AI-assisted workflows at any stage.</p>

    <p>Scalis uses AI to enhance recruiter efficiency and decision-making — not to remove the human judgment and relationship-building that drive successful hiring outcomes. Scalis does not make solely automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects; all final employment and hiring decisions involve human judgment.</p>

    <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
    <p>Scalis has a compliance program that includes both internal and independent auditing of AI as a provider of automated employee decision tools (AEDTs). We design our systems to comply with existing and expected regulatory compliance requirements. We address US States requirements such as California, New York, Colorado, Illinois. We address EU AI Act. We incorporate Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance on the use of AI and algorithmic tools in hiring and employment decisions. This includes ensuring our tools do not create discriminatory impact based on protected characteristics.</p>

    <h3>Fairness and Bias Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Scalis' compliance program includes preparing impact assessments, transparency notices, audits and disclosures. These provide our customers with the inputs to their regulatory and compliance program, allowing our assurance work to be included in their overall compliance preparedness and reporting.</p>

    <p>We conduct periodic fairness and bias testing and monitor performance to reduce disparate impact across demographic groups. A summary of our independent Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIIA) and Bias Audit will be published in our Trust Centre at <a href="https://trust.scalis.ai">https://trust.scalis.ai</a> when available. To request access under NDA, email <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why do we process personal data?</h2>
    <p>Scalis may process your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide our core AI-driven recruitment and matching services. This is our primary purpose. It involves using automated systems and AI to analyze personal data (like skills, experience, and job requirements) to create profiles and predict the suitability of candidates for specific roles and vice-versa.</li>
        <li>To manage, secure, and improve our Platform, including the performance of our AI models.</li>
        <li>For commercial contract purposes, such as fulfilling our service obligations to an employer using our Platform.</li>
        <li>To measure the use of our website and services.</li>
        <li>To contact you about newsletters or other marketing, but only if you have opted in.</li>
        <li>To verify your identity when necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>By what legal means do we process personal data?</h2>
    <p><strong>Scalis may process your data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>if you have given us permission to process personal data for one or more specific purposes. We are transparent and inform you so you can grant or remove consent with genuine choice and control;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for the performance of an agreement to which you are a party, or to take measures at your request prior to the conclusion of an agreement;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for our legitimate interest or of a third party unless your rights and interests outweigh either our or the third-party's legitimate interest;</li>
        <li>if processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another natural person;</li>
        <li>if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>You have rights.</strong></p>
    <p>You can ask us by any means, but sometimes under certain restrictions or conditions, to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>provide access to personal data;</li>
        <li>restrict or object to processing;</li>
        <li>rectify errors or erase personal data;</li>
        <li>receive a portable copy of personal data;</li>
        <li>obtain human intervention, express your point of view, and contest any decision made through automated processing;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can complain to a supervisory authority that is the data protection regulator.</p>

    <p>You may exercise these rights by submitting your request in writing or by phone to us, adjusting preferences in our consent manager, <strong>myConsentChoice</strong>, or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a>. We are required to verify your identity before your request can be met.</p>

    <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise below, we will respond to your request without undue delay, and within one month. In principle, your requests will be processed electronically (and will therefore be replied to by email), unless this is not possible, or you request otherwise.</p>

    <p>In principle, we will not charge you for request processing, unless your requests are excessive, manifestly unfounded or if you request additional copies when exercising your right of access, and charges are subject to applicable data protection law.</p>

    <h3>Viewing and/or modifying data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us at any time, by any means, to indicate which categories of your personal data we hold or are processed, for which purposes, from which data source, and what retention period(s) is(are) applied. In addition, you can ask us at any time to complete, correct or delete your data. We will correct inaccurate personal data we have about you. If we have changed your personal data, we will notify you accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Limit the processing of your data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to temporarily restrict, object to or withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data. We will tell you if we cannot honor your request and explain why.</p>

    <h3>Ask to transfer personal data</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to provide to you or a third party your personal data in a structured, common, and machine-readable form.</p>

    <h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
    <p>You can ask us to delete your personal data. We will tell you if we cannot honour your request and explain why.</p>

    <p>Exercising your rights does not affect processing that has already taken place, unless incorrect data has been used in previous processing and it can be reprocessed with correct data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Platform and services are not intended for or directed at individuals under the age of <strong>18</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a person under 18, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a></p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Security is a core part of our mission, and we take the protection of your information seriously. We apply industry-standard technical, organizational, and administrative measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, misuse, loss, or disclosure. These safeguards are designed to reflect the sensitivity of the information we collect, process, and store, as well as the current state of technology.</p>

    <p><strong>SOC 2 Compliance:</strong> Scalis is currently undergoing a SOC 2 Type II compliance audit to demonstrate our commitment to the highest standards of data security and privacy. Our security practices are designed to meet or exceed SOC 2 requirements for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</p>

    <p><strong>Payment Card Security:</strong> We use Stripe, Inc. as our third-party payment processor. Stripe is PCI DSS certified. Scalis does not store, process, or have access to your full payment card number. We only retain the last four digits of your card, expiration date, and billing information as necessary for our records and customer service.</p>

    <h3>Security Incident Response</h3>
    <p>In the event of a security incident that affects your personal data, we will notify you and relevant supervisory authorities in accordance with applicable law. We maintain an incident response plan to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. For questions about our incident response procedures, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@scalis.ai">privacy@scalis.ai</a>.</p>

    <p>For detailed and current information about our security practices, certifications, sub-processors, and compliance status, please visit our Trust Centre at <a href="https://trust.scalis.ai">https://trust.scalis.ai</a>.</p>

    <p>Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. For this reason, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information. If you use links that take you to third-party websites, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those sites.</p>

    <h2>Cookie Notice: Cookies And Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Scalis uses cookies and tracking technologies on our websites.</p>

    <p>In this Cookie Notice, we inform you about our cookies practices, a listing of cookies that are always enabled and others that are enabled after consent, their purpose and details such as classification, provider/domain, and retention period before expiry.</p>

    <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer to provide control for current functions while browsing our websites, for recognition of preferences on subsequent visits to our websites, and for third-party features.</p>

    <p>We use some cookies as strictly necessary components of our websites. We use other cookies in functional, analytical, and marketing categories only when you provide consent directly with <strong>myConsentChoice</strong> or when your browser provides preference information to myConsentChoice in the browser session.</p>

    <p>You will be prompted with <strong>myConsentChoice</strong> when visiting our websites. You can accept or reject all optional cookies or manage preferences within the consent manager. You can change your preferences to grant or withdraw consent at any time.</p>

    <p><strong>Universal Opt-Out Signals:</strong> We honor recognized universal opt-out preference signals (such as Global Privacy Control) where required by applicable law.</p>

    <p>We remember your consent preferences for 30 days. You can change your consent preferences at any time by clicking on the <strong>Manage Consent</strong> link from our website's footer. You can then adjust the available preference sliders to 'On' or 'Off', and save by clicking 'Save Choices'. You may need to refresh your page for your settings to take effect. The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user-identifiers (e.g., User-IDs) or advertising-identifiers are automatically deleted after the third-party expiry period. Monthly deletions for expired cookies and tracking technologies are processed automatically.</p>

    <h3>Google Processing</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited ("Google") is then enabled on our websites. The use includes the "Universal Analytics" operating mode.

    <h2>Third Parties and International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Scalis may engage third parties who process personal data as part of our Platform or Services. These third-party sub-processors act on our instruction under contract and under the same purposes and lawful bases set out in this privacy statement. These may be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(government) organizations;</li>
        <li>service providers; or</li>
        <li>contractors/suppliers, including but not limited to suppliers of IT services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Scalis remains accountable for personal data processing of our sub-processors as described in the Privacy Notice and under applicable data protection law.</p>

    <p>A current and comprehensive list of all sub-processors, including their names, locations, and the services they provide, is maintained and regularly updated in our Trust Centre at <a href="https://trust.scalis.ai">https://trust.scalis.ai</a>. We will provide notice of any changes to our sub-processor list through the Trust Centre and, where required, through direct communication with affected customers.</p>

    <p>We enter service agreements that include data processing addendums. The addendums include EU standard contractual clauses (SCC), UK international data transfer agreements or addendums (IDTA) or other contractual clauses and schedules as required by applicable data protection law.</p>

    <p>Scalis will not sell or share the data to any third party for its use in marketing or solicitation programs.</p>

    <p>The third party is a joint controller if we and the third party jointly define the purposes and means of processing. The third party is an independent controller if the third party defines the purposes and means of processing separately from us. The controller distinctions can vary depending upon data protection processing purposes and processing activities.</p>

    <h3>International Transfers</h3>
    <p>Scalis does business internationally. We may need to transfer your personal data to third parties established outside of designated areas of applicable data protection law, such as transfers outside the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.</p>

    <p>All international data transfers are subject to applicable data protection law. We follow the guidance and directives of those regulations, including the use of adequacy decisions by competent data protection supervisory authorities, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, UK International Data Transfer Agreements (IDTAs), and Swiss-specific contractual clauses as required by the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP). These contractual measures are supplemented by industry accepted technical and organisational measures including Transfer Impact Assessments where appropriate. We have measures that apply across all processing and ones tailored for distinct personal data processing purposes and processing activities. We will only transfer your personal data if an appropriate level of protection is in place.</p>

    <p>For international data transfers from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and equivalent transfer mechanisms as appropriate. These are supplemented by additional technical and organizational safeguards as required by applicable law and CJEU jurisprudence (including the Schrems II decision) to ensure adequate protection of your personal data.</p>

    <p>We maintain comprehensive documentation of our international transfer mechanisms and safeguards, including Transfer Impact Assessments, which are available upon request to supervisory authorities and as required by applicable data protection law.</p>
